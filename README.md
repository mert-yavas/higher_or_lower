# Celebrity Followers Comparison Game
## Overview
I am Mert, on Day 14 of my "100 Days of Python" challenge, I introduce the "Celebrity Followers Comparison Game." This Python application is not only an engaging tool for assessing the social media presence of celebrities but also serves as an educational platform to enhance understanding of key Python functions and programming concepts.
## Required Files and Libraries
To run this game, you will need the following files and Python libraries:

### Files:

* game_data.py: Contains the data about celebrities, including names, descriptions, countries, and follower counts.
* higher_lower_game.py: The main Python script to run the game.
* art.py: Contains ASCII art (such as the 'logo' and 'vs' symbols).
## Python Libraries:

* random: A built-in Python library used for generating random selections.
* replit: A third-party library used for clearing the console. Install it via pip with pip install replit.
* Please ensure these files are in the same directory and the required libraries are installed before running the game.
## Educational Objectives:
This project focuses on the practical application of the following Python functions and concepts:

* Random Module Usage: Demonstrates the use of Python's random module to select random items from a list, enhancing the unpredictability and replayability of the game.
* List Comprehensions: Utilizes list comprehensions for efficient data filtering and manipulation.
* Conditional Statements: Employs conditional (if/else) statements to implement game logic and decision-making processes.
* Loop Constructs: Implements while loops to manage the game flow and handle repeated actions until certain conditions are met.
* Function Definition and Calls: Showcases how to define and call custom functions, promoting code reusability and modularity.
* Input Handling and Validation: Focuses on handling user input and implementing basic validation checks to ensure the smooth operation of the game.
## Key Features
* Dynamic Celebrities Selection: Randomly selects celebrities to offer varied game sessions.
* Analytical Skills Enhancement: Challenges users to make informed guesses about celebrities' popularity.
* Score Keeping: Maintains a continuous tally of correct guesses.
* Immediate Feedback: Provides instant feedback on user guesses to enhance engagement.
* User-Friendly Interface: Prioritizes ease of use and clarity in presentation.
* Endurance Mode: Continues presenting new challenges until the first incorrect response.
## Invitation to Participate
The "Celebrity Followers Comparison Game" invites you to explore the intersection of celebrity culture and social media influence in an interactive format. It provides an excellent opportunity for Python learners to apply key programming concepts in a fun and engaging way. Try the game and see how well you can predict the social media following of today's celebrities while sharpening your Python skills!
